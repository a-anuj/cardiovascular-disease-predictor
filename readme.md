# ‚ù§Ô∏è Cardio Disease Prediction Model

This project implements a **Logistic Regression model** from scratch to predict the risk of cardiovascular disease based on health attributes like age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

No fancy ML libraries were used to train the model ‚Äî it‚Äôs all **NumPy-powered logic** with manually implemented cost functions and gradient descent.



## üöÄ Use Case

This model helps predict the **likelihood of cardiovascular disease** using multiple health factors. Real-world applications include:

- üè• **Hospitals & Clinics**: Early identification of high-risk patients for timely intervention.  
- üíâ **Healthcare Providers**: Design preventive care programs based on patient risk profiles.  
- üìä **Data Analysts & Researchers**: Analyze trends in cardiovascular risk factors.  
- üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è **Public Health Officials**: Allocate resources efficiently to vulnerable populations.

> With this model, stakeholders get an actionable tool to reduce cardiovascular incidents through early detection.


## üìä Dataset

The dataset contains various cardiovascular health parameters including:

- `age`  
- `gender`  
- `height`, `weight`  
- `systolic` and `diastolic blood pressure`  
- `cholesterol` levels  
- `glucose` levels  
- `smoking` and `alcohol` habits  
- `physical activity`  
- `cardiovascular disease` label (target variable)



## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ Data scaling with `StandardScaler`  
- ‚úÖ Logistic Regression implemented from scratch with gradient descent  
- ‚úÖ Binary classification with sigmoid activation  
- ‚úÖ Model evaluation via **accuracy score**  





## üéØ Demo

Here‚Äôs how the model works end-to-end:



## **Input** : User provides the following details:
- `age`  
- `gender`  
- `height`, `weight`  
- `systolic` and `diastolic blood pressure`  
- `cholesterol` levels  
- `glucose` levels  
- `smoking` and `alcohol` habits  
- `physical activity`  
- `cardiovascular disease` label (target variable)

## **Preprocessing**:
   - All features are scaled using StandardScaler.

   - Final data is shaped to match training input format.

## **Model Training**:
   - A custom implementation of **Logistic Regression** using **Gradient Descent**.
   - The model learns to minimize the cost over iterations. Finally it returns the values of w and b when the cost reaches the global minimum

## **Output**:
   - The model outputs a **probability score** for cardiovascular disease .
   - A threshold(can be changed to increase accuracy) is applied:
    
    If predicted probability ‚â• 0.4 ‚Üí Classified as 'High Risk'
    If predicted probability < 0.4 ‚Üí Classified as 'Low Risk'

## Accuracy
```text
Training Accuracy: ~97% 

Custom implementation accuracy may vary based on iterations and learning rate
